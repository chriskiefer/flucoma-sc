TITLE:: Fluid Decomposition Toolbox
SUMMARY:: An overview of the FluCoMa toolbox for signal decomposition
CATEGORIES:: Libraries>FluidCorpusManipulation


The Fluid Decomposition toolbox provides an open-ended, loosely coupled set of objects to break up and analyse sound in terms of slices (segments in time), layers (superpositions in time and frequency) and objects (configurable or discoverable patterns in sound). Almost all objects have audio-rate and buffer-based versions.

This toolbox was made possible thanks to the FluCoMa project ( LINK::http://www.flucoma.org/:: ) funded by the European Research Council ( LINK::https://erc.europa.eu/:: ) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 725899).
